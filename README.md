### Templating

- `{{ entry.phone.region }}` - The raw region code as entered in the field
- `{{ entry.phone.number }}` - The raw number as entered in the field
- `{{ entry.phone.getCountryCode() }}` - The alphabetical country code
- `{{ entry.phone.getRegionCode() }}` - The numerical region code
- `{{ entry.phone.getLink() }} ` - Returns a phone number link
- `{{ entry.phone.format('e164') }}` - Formats a phone number

#### Number Formatting

Numbers can be formated in the following formats:

| Format        | Example              |
| :------------ | :--------------------|
| e164          | +441174960123        |
| rfc3966       | tel:+44-117-496-0123 |
| national      | 0117 496 0123        |
| international | +44 117 496 0123     |

## Twig Filter

This plugin also adds a `tel` Twig filter for extracting phone numbers from a string and auto linking them using the rfc3966 format.

```twig
{{ entry.text|tel }}
```

By default only numbers entered in international format will be formatted. To format local number i.e. those without a region code such as +44, you can pass in a default country code to use when parsing.

```twig
{{ entry.text|tel('GB') }}
```
